# Auto Blog
### A lightweight Laravel CMS for the aspiring artist

Auto-Blog is a quick-and-dirty MVC application built in PHP Laravel. It features a lightweight CMS admin panel that allows the owner of the blog to quickly log in and create and update posts, or remove old ones that they don't want featured on the blog. It is styled in bootstrap for mobile-friendly viewing! 100% open source! Feel free to fork and use for your own project! 

## Running the project
Make sure that you have Laravel, Composer, and MySQL installed (and running!) on your system before issuing the following commands. 

Create the database for the application in MySQL. 

Populate the database with table structures:
`php artisan migrate`

Seed the database with default values 
`php artisan db:seed`

Start the development server
`php artisan serve`

## Enjoy!
